	- Getting the [[Computer Vision]] things working in the [[amxd Patch]] has been a pain in the ass. But i think if i directly is the resources provided by https://cycling74.com/forums/n4m-facemesh-handpose-google-mediapipe this resource, it could definitely work!
	- But with this resource, the main issue would be to get the ==**head rotation, pitch and other data**== working too

	- Got a prototype for [[Computer Vision]] working which uses node.script to trigger the [[python script]] and get values from it through node-osc.
	- Since I am already using a node script, i am guessing i can use another one for the speech model.
		- TODO See if you can run two node.script js files at the same time!

	- Both #[[Computer Vision]] and #[[Speech to text]] scripts are working. Both are python scripts so they do take some time to load up.
	- Will explore how to make these scripts more efficient in later builds but first need to figure out how to make it all work with the #[[Live Object Model (LOM)]].

	- Wasted too much time on doing the track input output routings but got them working not but with one bug reported in the [[BUG REPORT]]
	- I should really fasten this process now because there are two many features that are still to be mapped using the LOM model and it is going to take some time to then map them with the [[Computer Vision]] and [[Speech to text]]
	- Now the aim is to complete all the mixer parameters and then probably move forward to <u>Track Navigation</u> and then other features.

	- All the parameters of the mixer channel have been mapped! There are some bugs reported in the [[BUG REPORT]] but its a more irrelevant bug which would be used by some users, or maybe not even!
	- Feature to select track based on the track name has been added but I can see that the speech to text model wouldn't do such a great task at listening to track names precisely. I think I might have to use [[RegExp for Search]]
	- Added a feature to add Audio/MIDI track before a the currently selected track and create a return track as well.
