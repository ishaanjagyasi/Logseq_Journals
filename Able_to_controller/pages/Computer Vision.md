- I thing using this resource would be the most efficient of all, rather than anything else.
- Main things to extract from CV [[head-movements]] -
	- ==**Head Yaw, Pitch, Roll**==
	- ==**Head x, y, z**==
	- ==**Eyebrow Up & Down**==
- Final build of the CV module works in python using the ==**Google MediaPipe**== face landmarker.
	- The script takes some time to load up because the ==**node.script**== object triggers a shell script that runs the python script and completely detaches from node.
	- Despite this, I am able to get nice values out of it at a considerably smoother and low latency rates.
- [[Script Optimisation]]
	- Can potentially explore two options:-
		- Converting the whole script into JavaScript or C++
		- Just optimising the python script would also work since the libraries are already and since everything is packeted using the PyInstaller.

- DONE - 8th June 25
	- Need to find how I can run my [[python script]] on a server (?) and simply receive the OSC values in the [[amxd Patch]]
		- Search if there is a way to automatically trigger a pyhton script from within an [[amxd Patch]]
	- Potentially found out that ***pyinstaller*** (https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package. The user can run the packaged app without installing a Python interpreter or any modules.
